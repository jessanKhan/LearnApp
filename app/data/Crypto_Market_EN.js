        Title: 'VENEZUELA',
        Description:
          'In December 2017, Venezuela became the first and the only country in the world to issue its own cryptocurrency called the Petro. The country claims that the Petro is backed by physical commodities in the following proportions: 50% by Venezuelan oil reserves, 20% by gold, 20% by iron, and 10% by diamonds. Interestingly, market prices of all these commodities fluctuate on a daily basis and logically impact on the Petro’s value. However, the Petro’s exchange rate is set by the directive of the President.\r\n\r\nIn August 2018, Venezuela’s national currency, the sovereign bolivar, got pegged to the Petro. In fact, this move turned the new cryptocurrency into the official monetary unit.\r\n\r\nIn January 2019, the Constitutional Assembly released a constitutional decree on the integral system of crypto assets to regulate all issues about the legal use of cryptocurrencies across the country. According to this decree, all cryptocurrencies are assigned to digital assets. Their supervision is exercised by Sunacrip, the Agency of crypto assets and their derivatives. Besides, the Petro and other cryptocurrencies cannot be issued, mined or used in transactions without permission from the supervisory agency. If these or other formalities set out in the decree are breached, such violations are fined in the amount of up to $18,000. In other words, anyone who carries out transactions with cryptocurrencies has to obtain an appropriate license from Sunacrip. Later, in addition to a hefty fine, a penalty was made more severe with a forfeit of mining equipment. Sunacrip sets a commission for transactions in digital currencies in the amount of no more than 15% of a transaction’s value. The lowest commission is €0.25. Moreover, the biggest amount of transactions per month allowed by the watchdog is 10 Petros. To exceed this limit, one should apply to Sunacrip for permission.\r\n\r\nVenezuela’s legislation promotes the use of the national cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, the only legal tender in the country is the bolivar. The Petro is considered a security and digital asset. Therefore, if investment in the cryptocurrency generates returns, an investor must pay a tax of 34% like the one on business revenue. ',

        Title: 'JAPAN',
        Description:
          'At present, Japan is the country with perhaps the most elaborate and liberal legislation on cryptocurrencies. Indeed, such popular virtual currencies as Bitcoin and Ethereum are recognized as a lawful payment means because some of their features are similar to the ones of fiat money. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies do not have the status of fiat money, they can be just used for making online financial transactions in the same way as traditional payment systems. Japan’s legislation defines a cryptocurrency as a monetary unit worth a particular value which can be used for payments and transactions in the digital format. This wording allows companies and individuals to settle payments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, both legal entities and individuals are not permitted to declare earnings in cryptocurrencies because taxes are paid in yens. No wonder, Bitcoin and Ethereum are not the most popular payment means.\r\n\r\nJapan’s legislation sets some restrictions on the use of cryptocurrencies. Under Japan’s law, cryptocurrencies are assigned to electronic items. Nevertheless, being recognized as a payment means, digital currencies are exempt from a consumption tax which is charged for all goods and services. At the same time, all returns from buying and selling cryptocurrencies are treated as revenues from running a business because of speculations on their price fluctuations. So, such speculative transactions are subject to a tax of 30.86%.\r\n\r\nJapan’s legislation supervises the operation of cryptocurrency exchanges. Any provider of virtual currency exchange services must obtain a license to conduct such brokerage services. Besides, these companies must register with Japan’s Finance Services Agency. An application for the license is processed by the agency for no longer than two months. In the meantime, a cryptocurrency exchange is entitled to carry on with its services. In case the license is rejected, a provider should terminate its activities immediately. ',

        Title: 'SOUTH KOREA',
        Description:
          'According to the legislation of South Korea, cryptocurrencies are recognized as financial instruments, so they are subject to the same regulation as securities are. Nevertheless, they share some features with payment systems. Therefore, cryptocurrency exchanges and ATM kiosks must comply with the same regulation as banks do. Developing the legislation on digital currencies, South Korea’s monetary authorities aimed to combat money laundering. As a result, any client of a cryptocurrency ATM must attach his/her user account to an authentic account under his/her real name in a commercial bank. Otherwise, a client cannot conduct any transaction with virtual currency.\r\n\r\nAnother important thing. As a cryptocurrency is treated as a financial instrument, returns gained from such investment are subject to a tax in the same way as businesses report on their revenue and pay taxes. If a retail or institutional investor earns profits from their speculations with cryptocurrencies and they want to withdraw such profits from a special ATM kiosk, they have to pay a 25% tax of a profit gained.
