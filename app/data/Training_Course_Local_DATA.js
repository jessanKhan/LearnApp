        Description:
          "The Bitcoin protocol, launched in 2009, established for the first time the viability of transferring value on a peer-to-peer basis over the internet, without the need for a trusted intermediary. Bitcoin was truly the first incarnation of blockchain when Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, solved the 'double spend' problem: the issue that digital information can easily be copied, and therefore a centralised authority was previously required to reflect where funds were located.\r\nAlthough Bitcoin is very successful at transferring value and is an effective form of decentralised money, from the outset it was recognized that the same approach could be used to record information of almost any kind on the same shared basis. As well as cash, strings of characters on the blockchain could represent simple messages, ownership of physical or digital assets or securities, voting decisions, and so on.\r\n",

Due to Bitcoin’s position outside of the control of state and financial authorities and its potential for misuse as a tool of fraud, money laundering and other illegal activity, as well as other concerns such as its volatility and the unregulated nature of the exchanges on which it traded, the first reactions tended to be skepticism and concern. However, an increasing number of leaders have also recognized the potential of blockchain technology and the broad range of use cases to which the distributed ledger lends itself.',

        Description:
          'A blockchain is the term used to describe a modern distributed ledger technology (DLT). Traditional centralized databases have been employed for many years by entities, from governments to global institutions, to store data and record transactions of any kind. These are carefully-guarded and enclosed systems in which only authorized operators are allowed to make entries and govern the accuracy of data being stored. When a customer transfers money from one bank account to another, they make a request to the bank to do so on their behalf rather than engaging directly with the database that holds information about balances. Centralization is inherent in the existing paradigm.\r\n\r\nAt its simplest, the blockchain is a digital ledger that is stored on a network of computers around the world. Instead of securing information by restricting access, the blockchain shares information amongst all users that adhere to the protocol. For example, ownership of funds is cryptographically verified, and the full transparency and mutual ownership of the system means that a bad actor is immediately recognizable as such and any transactions submitted by such a malicious node are ignored.\r\n',

Immutability: Once confirmed, a transaction cannot be reversed and no one can compromise a confirmed transfer.\r\n3. Cost Efficiency: Transaction fees are minimal and determined upfront by the sender.\r\n4. Cross-border: Funds can be sent as easily to someone on the other side of the world as they can to someone in the next room.\r\n5. Transaction Speed: Due to the flat and transparent nature of the blockchain, transfers show up almost instantly and are typically confirmed in minutes, rather than hours or days.\r\nThe following sections will be dedicated to explaining the fundamental concepts underpinning the blockchain.\r\n',

The purpose of the blockchain network is to propagate transactions and blocks to all participants that subscribe to the blockchain protocol.\r\nA P2P network architecture consists of computers that participate in an open network and are peers to each other. The term peers is used since every participant is equal; there is no preferential treatment within nodes and all nodes share the burden of providing network services. There is no centralized service nor hierarchy within the network. Nodes in a P2P network both provide and consume services at the same time with reciprocity acting as the incentive for participation. P2P networks are inherently resilient, de-centralized, and accessible to anyone which is a true reflection and foundation of the core characteristics of blockchain.\r\nAny application can send the new transaction to any of the other clients it is connected to over any Internet channels, whether wired or wireless. Any network node that receives a valid transaction it has not seen before, will immediately forward it to other nodes to which it is connected. Thus, the transaction rapidly propagates out across the P2P network, reaching a large percentage of the nodes within seconds. This strength-in-numbers approach upholds the integrity of the protocol and secures the network because it lacks a sensitive central point-of-attack.\r\n',

The goal of consensus rules is to ensure a single chain is used and followed by every participant on the network without the need of a central trusted authority.

ICOs are usually conducted in order to launch a project. The project's participants are often big companies that maintain functioning of the system as they accept the cryptocurrency as a payment for their goods or services. This feature makes cryptocurrencies similar to stocks with the only difference: they can be used for settlements. \r\n        \r\nRecords about cryptocurrency transactions are stored in several places in a decentralized way unlike the traditional money. Participants of the cryptocurrency system are the ones who store and make records about all operations that are conducted with the cryptocurrency. This process is called mining. Those who are involved in mining provide their technical resources (a PC) for storage and processing of the data on transactions with a certain cryptocurrency. It ensures operation of the system. At the same time, the security of the system is maintained thanks to decentralized processing and storage of the data. However, this process is quite energy-consuming and requires high capacity of a computer. Those who provide their technical resources get the mined digital coins as a reward. \r\n\r\nMost projects have a limited amount of cryptocurrencies, and some part of them is placed initially at ICOs. The rest of the coins is put  into circulation as rewards for miners. However, the mining is not endless: sooner or later all coins get mined, so only processing of transactions and storage of the data are left to be done. As a reward for these activities, miners get a share of the commissions paid for the transactions with this cryptocurrency. \r\n        \r\nAlong with that, some projects have no limits on the amount of coins as they are issued as rewards for mining. \r\n     \r\nLately, the projects that imply no mining at all have become frequent.

          'IPO stands for an initial public offering, whereas an ICO is the initial coin offering. Both IPO and ICO have some similar features, however, there are some major differences as well.\r\nWithin an IPO, shares sold in the primary market belong to well-established and trustworthy companies with stable income. As for the ICO, it is very similar to crowdfunding since the token itself has no real value at the stage of launching. In other words, startup developers sell an idea rather than a final product.\r\n\r\nAn initial public offering is regulated by national legislation, and stock investors have certain guarantees unlike those who invest in ICOs. However, the IPO procedure is much more complicated. For example, in order to launch a public offering in the US, a company must be registered with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) and have the status of a joint-stock company. The process of an initial coin offering is easier to launch and is less restricted, but users have no guarantees.\r\n',

          'Despite high risks, a startup project can bring big profit for its investors. In case of a successful launch, the token’s popularity grows and so does the price. It is quite common nowadays when investors become immensely rich after buying tokens of a promising project. Ethereum can be a good example. In the summer of 2014, during the ICO, tokens were less than one cent, and today their price rises to $400.\r\n\r\nSelling tokens is not the only possible way to gain profit. You can use them to get the services stated in the project at a lower price.\r\n',

In crypto sphere, an airdrop is when a blockchain project distributes free tokens to the crypto community. \r\nUsually, airdrops are launched by a little-known startup to attract attention to their projects. These can be new cryptocurrencies, programs, apps, platforms, blog hosting services, etc. Startups attract investors offering them their services. When a startup is launched or is being developed it needs to raise awareness to its new project as well as find interested users.\r\nThe final goal of an airdrop is promotion.\r\nThe launch of an airdrop is similar to an ICO, notifications of the crypto community about new projects, or a Bounty campaign. The airdrop announcement is the following:\r\n\r\n• Famous crypto forums such as BitcoinTalk make a corresponding announcement. \r\n • An airdrop is announced on special platforms such as Airropalert.com \r\n • Platforms which gather information about crypto projects also provide the details about the upcoming airdrop of free tokens. \r\n • Telegram channels and social media accounts, dedicated to a new project, tell subscribers about an airdrop.  \r\nSuch information release takes place not long before a cryptocurrency airdrop and right after the distribution of tokens. Announcements can give you the details about an airdrop and its conditions as well as some facts about a project and its advantages.\r\n\r\n',

        Description:
          'Currently, there are two main methods to realize an airdrop.\r\nMethod 1.  The holders of a particular cryptocurrency can receive free tokens. The distribution of tokens is in correlation with the number of coins in user’s wallet. Tokens are sent automatically to wallet addresses.\r\nThis method is typical for developer of hard forks who try to enhance the efficiency of a parent cryptocurrency. Their primary goal is to attract users’ attention to the advanced version of the coin. \r\nFor example, let’s take a look at the distribution of Bitcoin Cash to Bitcoin holders. They received a number of coins equal to the amount of Bitcoins on their accounts.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are cases when conditions of airdrops change depending on developers’ decision. Thus, Bitcore was credited only to accounts of those Bitcoin holders who had at least 0.01 BTC on their account.\r\n Sometimes coins are distributed between holders of unrelated cryptocurrencies. For example, Bitcoin holders can get the Stellar Lumens coin. Nowadays, a common condition for an airdrop is a certain amount of Ethereum in your wallet.\r\nMethod 2.  Blockchain products distribute tokens in return for particular services. They can ask users to assist in project promotion, to leave comments, set an avatar, translate a text or be active on social media. In this case, anyone can receive free coins.\r\nIt is not beneficial for project developers to simply give tokens to people who left their wallets addresses and forgot about them. That is why, conditions of the distribution change every time. However, the primary goal of an airdrop is promotion of a new product which includes reposts on Facebook or Twitter. In return for free coins, users become members of particular crypto communities. In order to raise awareness to the project, developers use various Telegram channels, messengers and social platforms.\r\n\r\n',

Sometimes, users should have a large number of followers. Developers who choose bounty for their project, have to look for competent people. In an airdrop, simple actions are enough to promote a project.  \\n \r\n• An airdrop is easier to implement compared to a bounty.\\nRegistration for a bounty can be time-consuming compared to an airdrop. Participants of a bounty campaign can wait for two weeks in order to receive a reward. Complementary tokens for an airdrop come much faster. However, in the case of an airdrop, the distribution of free tokens can also be delayed. However, it is not about an airdrop, but about developers incompetence.\r\n\\n• A bounty reward is bigger than an airdrop reward.\\nUsers tried to calculate the difference between a reward for a bounty and an airdrop multiple times reporting about the results on various forums. They came to a conclusion that the remuneration ranges from tenfold to twentyfold if to participate in several projects at the same time. This information cannot be not 100% accurate.

You can get $50 for a hundred of hours. \\n\r\n\r\n            ⦁ Nobody can guarantee success of the project. There are tokens that never enter the cryptocurrency exchange. Moreover, you need to take into account token distribution delays, unexpected changes in conditions, and force majeure. \\n\r\n\r\n            • There are many fraudulent schemes when it comes to crypto airdrops. In particular, viruses can be spread via airdrops to steal money from user accounts. For example, holders of a certain amount of Bitcoin or other online currency make an announcement about free distribution of tokens. On the registration page you need to specify personal data, including the wallet address and the amount of money on the account. Sometimes, it is enough to get into the risk zone and lose money. There are even more tragic stories. A user is asked to enter the private key from the wallet to check the amount of funds in the account. Many users give it, instantly losing the accumulated funds. \r\n            \r\n\r\n',

Therefore, they monitor projects to be aware of future token distributions.\r\n\r\nIn order not to get in the hands of scammers, you need to be very attentive, control each your step from checking the website address to entering personal data. This does not include private keys, passwords and other highly confidential information.\r\n\r\nIf you do not have a popular social media account, there is no need to attract attention to it for the sake of an airdrop.

The Binance Launchpad platform emerged in 2017. It is designed to create tokens and trade new cryptocurrencies directly from the exchange. IEOs had remained in the background for a while. However, Binance’s latest initiative to introduce more digital currencies directly from the platform sparked great interest among investors around the world. \r\n        \r\nRecently, Binance Launchpad has held two IEO of Fetch and BitTorrent.

Obviously, these circumstances are not welcomed by investors.\r\n\r\nIEO procedure: Binance Launchpad announces new IEOs. Then, a token becomes available on a first-come, first-served basis. The tokensale is complete when the fundraising reaches its limit (Hard Cap). At that point, investors can immediately exchange tokens on Binance.\r\n        \r\nICOs lost their credibility when many of its tokens turned out to be a scam. At the same time, IEOs give investors’ confidence.\r\n        \r\nHowever, there is another difference between an ICO and an IEO. In case of an ICO, tokens are released right after the funding, while in an IEO, projects generate tokens and send them to the exchange.\r\n        \r\nInteresting fact: IEO’s capitalization amounted to $909.7 billion in the first six month of 2019. On average, projects have put up for sale about 4.4% of issued token. Information is based on BitMEX data.\r\n\r\n',

Binance team provides necessary training for chosen startups and allows them to use its 10 million audience platform for fundraising. The largest prestigious exchange is more reliable compared to numerous infamous scam-projects.\r\n\r\nBinance carefully collects information about each project before approving and presenting it to the huge audience of its users. A detailed profile allows Binance investors to weigh up the pros and cons before investing in a particular offer.\r\n\r\nBitmax Launchpad. The Bitmax exchange has also introduced its Launchpad. DOS Network became the first IEO when the token was launched on March 10, 2019. DOS Network promises to make the blockchain more user friendly with the help of real data and computing power.\r\n\r\nBittrex IEO. Bittrex announced the launch of its first IEO in March 2019. A new RAID token (Hard Cap - $6 million) was supposed to appear on the platform. According to official data, users could have bought coins for a set price directly from developers on the exchange. However, when the time of launch came, the exchange canceled the IEO promising to explain the reasons later.\r\n\r\nOKEx. The OK Jumpstart program will allow developers to sell tokens in order to finance their projects. OKEx is aimed at making financing safer. OKEx team is also planning to help developers to attract more investors. According to Andy Cheung, Head of Operations at OKEx, EIOs will be beneficial not only for the exchange but project developers as well. First of all, this applies to startuppers who are looking for means to implement their ideas.\r\n\r\nuCoin Spotlight. KuCoin representatives have also been thinking about their own IEO platform. Its name will be KuCoin Spotlight. Michael Gan, CEO at KuCoin, is pleased that the new platform will be able to find new tokens in a blockchain allowing exchange users to directly invest in financially profitable projects.\r\n\r\nHuobi Prime. The Huobi exchange follows a similar path. Its Huobi Prime platform will be slightly different from others. According to developers, it will become a platform for selective listing of tokens based on their native coin - the Huobi token. Huobi Prime team continues working on the platform in order to offer high-quality crypto projects an innovative, fast, and compatible coin listing service.',
