The key feature of the project is the possibility of parallel mining (that is, SYS tokens can be mined together with others). Based on the Syscoin network, you can create your own platforms. Syscoin has a specialized encryption algorithm. This allows you to remain anonymous. The project focuses on the arbitration agreement. The system plays the role of an intermediary between sellers and buyers preserving the security of the operations performed. Syscoin is a unique way of attracting all types of businesses with the help of the expanded functionality focused on the financial segment. The hashing algorithm is Scrypt.
